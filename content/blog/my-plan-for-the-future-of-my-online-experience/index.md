Often times I go on the internet and wonder how I could've lived without it.

I know it's possible since people have done it for thousands of years before me, however having grown up with computers as a large part of my frame of reference and a regular part of life. To imagine a life without them is to image the childhood of someone I don't know. Difficult.

# My thoughts on software
I have a dream of one day changing the world through software. I have a very specific dream that the things I am putting time and effort into right now will ultimately put time and effort into themselves.

# My thoughts and desires on lifestyle
I have a vision where my car drives itself so I don't have to. I'm thinking radical optimization. Everything just works. It's till quite a while away but it's a start to get my calendar in order.
I'm excited for when everything just.. works.

# My thoughts on civilization
A land where we all do the things that only we can do and let computers do the rest.
A land where our talents are fully utilized, and not just to the degree we can enjoy them and still be employed, but rather to the degree and depth that they contribute to our livelihood and to the fulfillment of our existence.

# My thoughts on justice
With some lovely technology, we can use artificial intelligence to predict crimes before they take place. I have mixed feelings about this, because I don't see it as just to convict a five year old for the mass murder they will be guilt of 50 years in the future. Or to kill a new born baby because they will be executed by means of lethal injection of other for their crimes assumed to be committed. Perhaps you can let me know your thoughts in the comments below?

# My thoughts on life
Ultimately, I just want to use what I'm good at to help others and make Jesus proud. I think He'd like that. For my writing on Jesus & Christianity check out [ChristianAdulting.com](https://christianadulting.com?ref=collins)
